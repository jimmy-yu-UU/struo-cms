# Changelog

## 0.8.0

::: danger Breaking
- The framework's 12 tables carry a prefix set by `Database:TablePrefix`, default `struo_` (`users` →
  `struo_users`, `schema_migrations` → `struo_schema_migrations`). Sample and fork collections are not
  prefixed. On an existing database, startup creates a fresh, empty set of framework tables under the
  new names and seeds them (bootstrap admin included); the existing tables are not read. Pick one: set
  `Database:TablePrefix` to the empty string to keep the existing tables, or rename them to the
  prefixed names before starting.
- Core index and unique-constraint names follow the table name: `ix_<table>_<column>`,
  `ux_<table>_<meaning>`, for example `ux_struo_revisions_item_no`. Update any migration of yours that
  refers to a core index by name.

### Added

- `Database:TablePrefix` configuration key (env `Database__TablePrefix`), validated at startup.
